#Swiss localities

##Description
A multilingual reference of localities in Switzerland.

The data contained in this repository is intended for general use. It contains an (**as yet incomplete**) list of localities 
(cities, towns, villages) in Switzerland, with the locality's name in each of the Swiss official languages, plus English. 
It also contains a postal code for each entry, mainly for corroboration of the name, and a two-letter code to indicate 
the canton in which the locality lies.

The original data set for this repository was drawn from the website at http://www.bahn-bus-ch.de/sprachen/orte.html on 
23rd February 2016 and converted to a tab-separated file. The original data was formerly updated on 2nd January 2011.

No accuracy or formal sanction of the data in this repository is given or implied. Amendments and corrections are very 
welcome: please fork the repository, make your modifications, and send them back as a pull request. Please ensure that 
the file is sorted by the first column - i.e. the German name of the locality.
